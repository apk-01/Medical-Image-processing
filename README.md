# Medical-Image-processing
This repository explores the various medical image processing techniques using Python. We shall be using modules like: scikit-image, PIL, opencv, flowdec and starFISH.
We are using sample data from https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.html and https://cellprofiler.org/

The codes are written on : google colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)

# 3D deconvolution
Deconvolution is an image processing technique used to improve the contrast and sharpness of images captured using a light microscope. Each point source below the diffraction limit is blurred by the microscope into what is known as a point spread function (PSF). Deconvolution functions use this known PSF values(based on microcope's parameters) to deblur the images.
Example:
